# Creating a Project in Toddle

This guide will walk you through the process of creating a new project in Toddle and help you understand the project structure.

## Creating a New Project

1. Log in to your Toddle account at [toddle.dev](https://toddle.dev).
2. On the dashboard, click the "New Project" button in the top right corner.

3. You'll be presented with a choice of templates. You can either:
   - Choose a pre-made template for specific types of projects
   - Select "Blank Template" to start from scratch

4. After selecting a template, you'll need to provide some details for your project:
   - Project Name: Choose a descriptive name for your project
   - Project ID: This will be used in the URL for your project (e.g., my-new-project.toddle.site)
   - Emoji (optional): Select an emoji to represent your project

5. Click "Create Project" to finalize the creation of your new project.

## Understanding Project Structure

Once your project is created, you'll be taken to the Toddle editor. Here's a brief overview of the project structure:

1. **Pages**: Your project starts with a main page (usually named "Home"). You can add more pages as your project grows.

2. **Components**: These are reusable elements that you can create and use across your project.

3. **Assets**: This is where you can manage any media files (images, videos, etc.) used in your project.

4. **APIs**: If your project needs to interact with external data sources, you can set up API connections here.

5. **Variables**: These allow you to store and manage data within your project.

**Note:** You can access and manage these different aspects of your project using the project sidebar, which can be opened by clicking on the project name in the top left corner of the editor.
